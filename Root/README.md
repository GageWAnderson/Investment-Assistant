Project MVP Due: June 1st

__Requires Node v 13+ because of ES6__

Run only backend: cd into *Root*, run `npm run Backend`

Run only frontend: cd into *Root*, run `npm run Frontend`

Run both backend and frontend: cd into *Root*, run `npm run dev`

dependancies: In package.json file IN BACKEND FOLDER


Stack:
- Node JS
- Express JS (Node + Express for backend)
- Mongo DB (Database)
- React JS (Front-End)

Other:
- Use Docker to Contain the project and its dependancies
- Use npm to manage dependancies
- Uses ES6 Style by having "type": "module" in package.json
  - This requires that the latest version of Node (v14.2.0) is installed

Features:
1. Calculated net portfolio worth for each user
2. Calculate net portfolio worth by sector for each user (user makes sectors themselves)
3. Create an automatic portfolio rebalancer (keep each sector of the portfolio at the same percentage
of portfolio size) simply by pressing a button
