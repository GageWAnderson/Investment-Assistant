TL;DR:
to run (backend): npm run dev-start
dependancies: In package.json file IN BACKEND FOLDER

Stack:
Node JS
Express JS (Node + Express for backend)
Mongo DB (Database)
React JS (Front-End)

Other:

Use npm to manage dependancies
Uses ES6 Style by having "type": "module" in package.json
  - This requires that the latest version of Node (v14.2.0) is installed

Features:
1. Calculated net portfolio worth for each user
2. Calculate net portfolio worth by sector for each user (user makes sectors themselves)
3. Create an automatic portfolio rebalancer (keep each sector of the portfolio at the same percentage
of portfolio size) simply by pressing a button
